                                Mobile data offloading leverages more
                                affordable or even free network capacity to
                                reduce the traffic experienced by cellular
                                operators through their limited over-the-air
                                resources. One way to harvest free capacity
                                is to employ the white space, namely,
                                frequencies that are assigned to licensed users
                                but are not actively utilized, as long as no
                                harmful interference is generated. In this talk,
                                we characterize the benefits of harnessing node
                                contacts for mobile content offloading through
                                dynamic spectrum access assisted by a white
                                space database (WSDB). We take a content-centric
                                approach and model the selection of distributors
                                among the subscribers of each content served
                                through a base station. We formulate an
                                optimization problem to maximize the offloading
                                gain based on realistic settings. We show that
                                such a problem is NP-hard and devise efficient
                                heuristics for practical mobile data offloading.
                                Our results show that the offloading gain
                                allowed by white space is significant even when
                                WSDB data are inaccurate.

                                We propose INFv – the first offloading
                                system able to cache, migrate and dynamically
                                execute on demand functionality from mobile
                                devices in ISP networks. INFv is motivated by
                                the huge disparity between the limited battery
                                capacity of user devices and the ever-growing
                                energy demands of mod- ern mobile apps. It aims
                                to bridge this gap by extending the promising
                                NFV paradigm to mobile applications in order to
                                exploit in-network resources.

                                In this talk, we present the overall design,
                                key algorithms, and state-of-the-art
                                technologies adopted in the INFv system, a
                                careful study of over 20K Google Play apps,
                                as well as thorough evaluations with realistic
                                settings. In addition to a significant
                                improvement in battery life (i.e., up to 6.9x
                                energy reduction) and execution time (up to 4x
                                faster), INFv has two distinct advantages over
                                previous systems: 1) a non-intrusive offloading
                                mechanism transparent to exist- ing apps; 2) an
                                inherent network subsystem to effectively
                                balance computation load and exploit the
                                proximity of in- network resources. Both
                                advantages together enable a scalable and
                                incremental deployment of computation
                                offloading framework in practice.

                                The exploitation of an opportunistic
                                infrastructure via computational offloading
                                is a critical component towards the adoption
                                of new paradigms such as edge and fog computing.
                                Computational offloading is a promising
                                technique to aid the processing of a mobile
                                device. By offloading a computational task a
                                device can save energy and increase the
                                performance of the mobile applications.
                                Unfortunately, in classical offloading systems,
                                the opportunistic moments to offload a task are
                                sporadic and short-term. In this talk, we explore
                                a hybrid system that merges cloudlet,
                                Device-to-Device (D2D) and remote cloud models
                                in order to increase the spectrum of
                                opportunistic offloading. We analyze and
                                evaluate our system in the wild and found
                                that in a realistic environment, a mobile
                                is always co-located to a source that provides
                                offloading support. This suggests that a device
                                can schedule the processing of tasks in
                                coordination with other devices, potentially
                                more powerful, instead of handling the
                                processing of the tasks by itself.

                                signaling messages for replicating the state
                                of the mobile devices using the LTE network.
                                Modularizing these network functions would
                                enable a refactoring of the LTE network
                                allowing operators to compose networks that
                                adapt and evolve with the influx of
                                verticals. In this article, we present a new
                                approach for refactoring the network
                                functions serving LTE networks. In particular,
                                we show that it is possible to separate and
                                modularize the control and data planes of LTE
                                networks without modifying the mobile devices.
                                With the help of three use-cases, we show that
                                our refactoring approach can be leveraged to
                                compose a modular mobile network optimized for
                                the verticals using its services. We also show
                                that deploying network functions at the edge
                                significantly reduces the signals exchanged
                                within a mobile network.

                                Phishing is a major problem on the Web. Despite
                                the significant attention it has received over
                                the years, there has been no definitive solution
                                . Existing solutions for steering users away
                                from phishing websites are typically
                                server-based and have several drawbacks: they
                                compromise user privacy, are not robust against
                                adaptive attackers who serve different content
                                at different times, and do not provide any
                                guidance to users after flagging a website as
                                a phish.
                                <br>
                                To address these limitations, we present a new
                                phishing prevention system implemented as a
                                client-side application and a browser add-on.
                                It uses information extracted from website
                                visited by the user to detect if it is a phish
                                and warn the user. It also determines the target
                                of the phish and offers to redirect the user
                                there. The underlying technique for phishing
                                detection and target identification relies on
                                two core observations:
                                <ol type="a">
                                    <li>Although phishers try to make a phishing
                                        webpage look similar to its target, they
                                        do not have unlimited freedom in
                                        structuring the phishing webpage</li>
                                    <li>A webpage can be characterized by a
                                        small set of key terms; how these key
                                        terms are used in different parts of a
                                        webpage is different in the case of
                                        legitimate and phishing webpages.</li>
                                </ol>
                                Based on these observations, we developed a
                                machine learning based phishing detection
                                system with several notable properties: it
                                requires very little training data, scales well
                                to much larger test data, is
                                language-independent, fast, resilient to
                                adaptive attacks and implemented entirely on
                                client-side. In addition, we developed a target
                                identification component that can identify the
                                target website that a phishing webpage is
                                attempting to mimic.

                                permission-based access control cannot control
                                how sensitive might be used within the same app.
                                For example, if an app obtains the permission to
                                access location, it can use it for both

                                Mobile Augmented Reality (MAR) is widely
                                regarded as one of the most promising
                                technologies in the next ten years. With MAR,
                                we are able to blend information from our senses
                                and mobile devices in myriad ways that were not
                                possible before. The way to supplement the real
                                world other than to replace real world with an
                                artificial environment makes it especially
                                preferable for applications such as tourism,
                                navigation, entertainment, advertisement, and
                                education.  In this talk, I will first give an

                                System and Media Lab and then I will use two
                                systems that we have developed as examples to
                                illustrate the research challenges that we have
                                to face for our research. These two MAR systems

                                With the increasing popularity of
                                smartphone-based applications and mobile
                                computing, the role of context as a factor in
                                security and privacy enforcement is gaining in
                                importance, both as an asset to be protected and
                                as a factor to base security policy decisions
                                on. <br>
                                With context we mean any observable features of
                                a mobile device's ambient environment, which
                                the device is able to observe using its on-board
                                sensors. Examples of possible context modalities
                                include, e.g., ambient light, noise level,
                                temperature as well as WiFi and Bluetooth devices
                                in the user's RF environment. While the use of
                                context information opens great opportunities
                                for developing apps, it also involves threats
                                against the user's privacy, as many apps and
                                device features require access to information
                                about the user's context. Contextual data can
                                potentially reveal a lot of private information
                                about the user, if it is revealed to
                                unauthorised parties. However, context can also
                                help in adapting the behaviour of a mobile
                                device and adjusting security and privacy
                                policies according to specific situations. In
                                this talk I will give an introduction to some
                                recent work related to context-based policy
                                enforcement and the use of context in security
                                protocols, in particular as an enabler for
                                proofs-of-presence that are not dependent on a
                                particular infrastructure.

                                Achieving accurate, real-time, and spatially
                                fine-grained population estimation for a
                                metropolitan city is extremely valuable for a
                                variety of applications. Previous solutions
                                look at data generated by human activities,
                                such as night time lights and phone calls, for
                                population estimation. However, these mechanisms
                                cannot achieve both real-time and fine-grained
                                population estimation because the data sampling
                                rate is low and spatial granularity chosen is
                                improper. We address these two problems by
                                leveraging a key insight — people frequently
                                use data plan on cellphones and leave mobility
                                signatures on cellular networks. Therefore, we
                                are able to exploit these cellular signatures
                                for real-time population estimation. Extracting
                                population information from cellular data
                                records is not easy because the number of users
                                recorded by a cellular tower is not equal to the
                                population covered by the tower, and mobile
                                users’ behavior is spatially and temporally
                                different, where static estimating model does
                                not work. We exploit context-aware city
                                segmentation and dynamic population estimation
                                model to address these challenges. We show that
                                the population estimation error is reduced by
                                22.5% on a cellular dataset that includes 1
                                million users.

                                The number of connected devices is increasing
                                exponentially, which has made the job of
                                managing and securing networks more complex and
                                demanding than ever before. In this paper, we
                                present a novel service-based solution for
                                securing edge networks that are poorly managed
                                and do not offer adequate security and
                                management features. Our proposed system
                                includes a smart gateway Securebox offering
                                advanced security and network management
                                features at device level granularity and a
                                Security and Management Service (SMS) which

                                network and security policy etc. Instead of
                                tight coupling with hardware, our system
                                enables flexible and on-demand deployment of

                                The increasing computing and storage capacity at
                                the wireless access nodes (eNodeB and Access
                                Points) creates opportunities for content
                                caching at the wireless edge and, therefore,
                                further reduction of content delivery
                                latency. However, realizing a large-scale
                                content caching at the wireless edge entails
                                significant challenges, due to the difficulties
                                of managing the vast amount of cached content
                                and handling redirections among the large number
                                of nodes.  This talk covers a collaborative
                                content caching at wireless edge nodes by
                                coupling a low-false-positive hash table to
                                index the cached content with centralized
                                content redirection. This architecture is
                                applicable to both web caching and IoT cases.

                                Breakthroughs from the field of deep learning
                                are radically changing how sensor data are
                                interpreted. It is critical that the gains in
                                inference qualities that deep models afford
                                become embedded in the future generation of
                                mobile and IoT applications. However,
                                significant requirements of memory and
                                computational power have been the main
                                bottlenecks in the wide-scale adoption of
                                these novel computational techniques on resource
                                constrained wearable and mobile platforms.
                                <br> In this talk, we present novel design
                                principles that significantly lower the device
                                resources (viz. memory, computation, energy)
                                required by deep learning to overcome severe
                                challenges to their mobile adoption. The main
                                foundations of our approach are based on
                                resource control algorithms and runtime resource
                                scaling of deep model architectures, which are
                                designed for the inference stage. Experiments
                                show that the proposed optimizations allow even
                                large-scale deep learning models to execute

                                require smart devices to be connected to the

                                The popularity of digital currencies, especially
                                crypto-currencies, has been continuously growing
                                since the appearance of Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a
                                peer-to-peer (P2P) cryptocurrency protocol
                                enabling transactions between individuals
                                without the need of a trusted authority. Its
                                network is formed from resources contributed by
                                individuals known as miners. Users of Bitcoin
                                currency create transactions that are stored in
                                a specialised data structure called a block
                                chain. Bitcoin's security lies in a 
                                proof-of-work scheme, which requires high
                                computational resources at the miners. These
                                miners have to be synchronised with any update
                                in the network, which produces high data traffic
                                rates. Despite advances in mobile technology,
                                no cryptocurrencies have been proposed for
                                mobile devices. This is largely due to the
                                lower processing capabilities of mobile devices
                                when compared with conventional computers and
                                the poorer Internet connectivity to that of the
                                wired networking. In this work, we propose 
                                LocalCoin, an alternative cryptocurrency that
                                requires minimal computational resources,
                                produces low data traffic and works with
                                off-the-shelf mobile devices. LocalCoin replaces
                                the computational hardness that is at the root
                                of Bitcoin's security with the social hardness
                                of ensuring that all witnesses to a transaction
                                are colluders. It is based on opportunistic
                                networking rather than relying on infrastructure
                                and incorporates characteristics of mobile
                                networks such as users' locations and their
                                coverage radius in order to employ an
                                alternative proof-of-work scheme. Local coin
                                features (i) a lightweight proof-of-work scheme
                                and (ii) a distributed block chain.

                                One of challenges of emerging big data research
                                is to perform efficient and robust data
                                processing with limited memory/computation
                                power. I will introduce large-scale data
                                processing from various perspectives: what and
                                why large data, what technologies apply to big
                                data, and what are the main challenges. Then,
                                I would present our recent work on the graph
                                processing that have billions of vertices and
                                edges in a commodity single computer. Executing
                                algorithms results in access to the external
                                memory (e.g. SSD) and performance of I/O takes
                                an important role, regardless of the algorithmic
                                complexity or runtime efficiency of the actual

                                A large number of cellular network accessing
                                records are generated by cellular users,
                                collected by cellular network operators and
                                applications running on mobile phones, and
                                publicly released for academic research or
                                privately sold for commercial purpose. One step
                                the mobile operators and application vendors
                                usually do before releasing is removing the
                                identification(ID) of each entry in the records.
                                Many cellular operators and applications vendors
                                believe that such anonymization is sufficient
                                for preserving the privacy of mobile users.
                                However, in this paper, we argue and prove that
                                simply removing the IDs is not sufficient for
                                preserving mobile users’ privacy. We develop a
                                mechanism that is able to extract the mobility
                                patterns of users from cellular records and
                                associate each record with a user, which means
                                the ID is recovered, according to their mobility
                                characteristics. We are able to associate

                                It is still challenging in telecommunication
                                (telco) industry to accurately locate mobile
                                devices (MDs) at city-scale using the
                                measurement report (MR) data. The MR measure
                                parameters of radio signal strengths when MDs
                                connect with base stations (BSs) in telco
                                networks for making/receiving calls or mobile
                                broadband (MBB) services. In this paper, we
                                find that the widely-used location based
                                services (LBSs) have accumulated lots of
                                over-the-top (OTT) global positioning system
                                (GPS) data in telco networks, and can be
                                automatically used as training labels for
                                learning accurate MR-based positioning systems.
                                Benefiting from these telco big data, we deploy
                                a context-aware coarse-to-fine regression (CCR)
                                model in Spark/Hadoop-based telco big data
                                platform for city-scale localization of MDs.
                                Our experiments on real Shanghai city data show
                                that our model achieves a mean error of 110m and
                                a median error of 80m, outperforming the
                                state-of-art range-based and fingerprinting
                                localization methods.
